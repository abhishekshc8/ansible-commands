alka1@controlnode:~/test$ ansible-playbook --syntax-check first.yml
ERROR! We were unable to read either as JSON nor YAML, these are the errors we got from each:
JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)

Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  did not find expected key

The error appears to be in '/home/alka1/test/first.yml': line 9, column 5, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

        state: present
    - name: Start Apadche Web Server
    ^ here
alka1@controlnode:~/test$ cat first.yml
- name: Installing the Apache Webserver
